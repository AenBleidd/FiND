autodock-vina for Debian
------------------------

No changes were done to upstream's source code,
just the name of the base directory adjusted
to the Debian policy.

The build process was adjusted according to
http://vina.scripps.edu/manual.html#build
and an otherwise missing Makefile added to
allow the direct application of cdbs.

The man pages were created with help2man
(also available as a Debian package) and
are overdue to be manually improved.
